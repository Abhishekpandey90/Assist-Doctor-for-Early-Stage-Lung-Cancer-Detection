# Assist Doctor for Early Stage Lung Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project aims to assist medical professionals in the early detection of lung cancer using deep learning techniques. Early detection can significantly improve survival rates and reduce the burden of late-stage treatments.

The system uses medical imaging data, such as CT scans or X-rays, to identify patterns indicative of early-stage lung cancer. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, the project provides accurate and efficient predictions to support clinical decisions.

## Features
- **Automated Cancer Detection:** AI-powered model to analyze medical imaging and predict cancer stages.
- **High Accuracy:** Uses advanced deep learning architectures for reliable results.
- **Explainable Results:** Visualization of important features in the imaging data.
- **Scalable:** Designed to integrate with hospital systems for real-time usage.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the medical imaging dataset (CT scans, X-rays).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `outputs/`: Results such as performance metrics and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the project.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Sourced medical imaging datasets for lung cancer detection.
   - Annotated with labels for cancerous and non-cancerous cases.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resized images to a uniform size.
   - Augmented data to increase diversity and reduce overfitting.
   - Normalized pixel values for better model convergence.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis.
   - Fine-tuned pre-trained models such as EfficientNet and ResNet.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized feature importance with Grad-CAM.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Exported the model for real-world integration using ONNX or TensorFlow Serving.
